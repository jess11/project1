# Twitter simplified

This is twitter but a more simplified version. If you want to share text posts with your friends or the general public you can do that with Twitter simplified. You can even follow people and their posts will appear in your feed.

Just sign up, edit your profile and start posting away.

You can even see the location of all the users on the map's tab.

If you want a surprise, type in Madagascar as your location and the easter egg will be revealed.
